## Python password-locker
## Author : Charles Opuba
### Description
I have created an application that will help us manage our passwords and even generate new passwords for us.
## User stories
- As a user, I want to create a password locker account with my details, a login username and password.
- As a user, I want to store my already existing account credentials in the application. Assuming I already have a twitter account, I want to store my already existing twitter username and password in the application
- As a user, I want to create new account credentials in the application. For example, if I have not yet signed up for Instagram, I would want to create a credentials account for Instagram in the application and the application generates a password for me to use when I sign up for Instagram.
- As a user, I want to have the option of putting in a password that I want to use for the new credential account. For example, when creating my Instagram credential account, I want to have an option of putting in the password I want to use instead of having the application generate a password for me.
- As a user, I also want to view my various account credentials and their passwords in the application
- As a user, I want to delete a credentials account that I no longer need in the application.
